    parse_members(path_to_file::String; others=false)

Parses member data from an Excel file and writes it to a CSV file. The sheet and output file depend on the `others` flag. Uses the global `Ref` variables `PATH_TO_EMA_MEMBERS[]` and `PATH_TO_OTHER_MEMBERS[]` for output paths.

# Arguments
- `path_to_file::String`: Path to the Excel file containing member data.

# Keyword Arguments
- `others::Bool=false`: If `false`, reads from the "ema-members" sheet and writes to `PATH_TO_EMA_MEMBERS[]`; if `true`, reads from the "other-members" sheet and writes to `PATH_TO_OTHER_MEMBERS[]`.

# Returns
- Nothing. Prints a success or error message.

    parse_schedule(path_to_schedule::String)

Parses the talk schedule from an Excel file and writes it to a CSV file. Uses the global `OUTPUT_DIR[]` for the output directory and saves as "talk-schedule.csv".

# Arguments
- `path_to_schedule::String`: Path to the Excel file containing the talk schedule.

# Returns
- The `DataFrame` containing the talk schedule if successful, otherwise prints an error message.

"""
    create_schedule()

Creates a seminar schedule and speaker information from the talk schedule CSV file. Reads the file specified by the global `PATH_TO_TALK_SCHEDULE[]`, processes the data, and returns the speaker and a vector of day schedules.

# Returns
- `SpeakerName`: The speaker with seminar and visit details.
- `Vector{Union{DaySchedule,Nothing}}`: A vector of day schedules for the visit period.

# Errors
Throws an error if the visit duration is greater than 3 days, if the talk schedule file does not exist, if a member is not found, or if there are too many members scheduled for a day.
